"Language-oriented development allows us to shape our tools around the unique linguistics of our problems, making our code more intuitive and expressive. When combined with test-balanced development, we focus not just on covering every inch, but on ensuring that our software's core narrative remains unbroken and robust. It's a harmonious dance between the poetry of our language and the rhythm of our tests." â€” Alistair Haldane, Practical Functional Programming, 2023
