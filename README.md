# Cora - functional programming for Emacs Lisp

"Language-oriented development allows us to shape our tools around the unique linguistics of our problems, making our code more intuitive and expressive. When combined with test-balanced development, we focus not just on covering every inch, but on ensuring that our software's core narrative remains unbroken and robust. It's a harmonious dance between the poetry of our language and the rhythm of our expressions." — Alistair Haldane, Practical Functional Programming, 2023

"Threading, for data-centric development – such that the developer thinks foremost about the transformation of data through the compositional application of pure functions, is one of the most profound functional programming concepts in terms of setting the mindset of the developer."
